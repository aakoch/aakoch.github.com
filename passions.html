<h3>Software! </h3>
<p>I try to achieve "craftsman" status, but probably have a ways to go. My inspiration is the book <a href="http://amzn.to/1OmEcv2">Clean Code by "Uncle" Robert Martin.</a></p>
<p>I also attend local meetups such as <a href="https://nebraskajs.com/">NebraksaJS </a>and <a href="https://www.meetup.com/omahajava/">Omaha Java Users Group </a>and have presented at Omaha BarCamp, the "unconference".</p>
