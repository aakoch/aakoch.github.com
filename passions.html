<h2>Passions</h2>
<h3>Clean Code </h3>
<p>The book <a href="http://amzn.to/1OmEcv2">Clean Code by "Uncle" Robert Martin </a>changed my life.</p>
<p>I also really enjoy reviewing code.</p>
<h3>Teaching</h3>
<p>I've starting to realize that I love sharing things. At my company I teach classes, volunteer to be on panels, post my findings/research on the wiki, and send emails with tips and tricks. The only problem is, I'm not a very good speaker. I'm not good with things coming up right off the top of my head. I'm better at a "longer" medium where I can collect my thoughts before presenting them.</p>
<h3>User Interface Design</h3>
<p>I used to work on the User Experience team which included Human Factors, the team with degrees in Human-Computer Interaction. Before working with that team I thought, as I expect most developers without that kind of exposure, that my interfaces were fine. But I believe I learned a lot and have gained "an eye" for bad UI design.</p>
<h3>Security</h3>
<p>I'm am facinated and often amazed with the abilities of hackers and sometimes contemplate what vulnerabilities are in my apps.</p>
<h3>New Technologies</h3>
<p>From new hardware devices to electronics to software projects, I get excited reading about advances in technology. I like to try them out BUT, and that's a big but, I don't always think the cutting edge is right for the enterprise. </p>
